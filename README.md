# AICTEProject
Develop a system to predict the likelihood of disease outbreaks using machine learning techniques. 
The system will utilize various datasets containing diagnostic, demographic, and biomedical 
information to model the occurrence of specific diseases, facilitating early intervention and better 
resource allocation. 

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to create predictive models for 
disease outbreak analysis. By utilizing datasets specific to heart disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, and 
diabetes, the system will:

Preprocess data

Model diseases

Evaluate Models

Deploy interactive Interface

# Tools:
